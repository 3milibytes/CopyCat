# ROADMAP

## Vision Statement

<i>We’re working with young Software Developers in India to build a cross platform application to facilitate easy sharing of clipboard data across multiple devices of an user. Our aim is, to incorporate young, brighter and inquisitive minds from across the Internet.</i>

<hr>
Our project is a multi device clipboard manager that aims to facilitate easy sharing of clipboard data across a user’s multiple devices. Thus the idea is to float the clipboard data on a common storage area which can be accessed through desktop apps and android apps. The clipboard management system would be exposed to the user in the form of apps on all possible devices - desktops, tablets, android, iOS, or even smart TVs


## Milestones

### Conducting research over any existing prior work.

It is evident that previous efforts in this field have produced consistent results. These approaches, fetching, caching and encrypting can be more or less carried over to CopyCat. Therefore, it is only natural that we import some of these works and incorporate them into the project.

### Coming up with database schemas and data flow diagrams

Any major software implementation requires a proper documentation of the entire project. This step would involve constructing Schemas for the entire data. A database schema defines its entities and the relationship among them. Once the schema is complete, we will proceed with the data flow diagrams.  Data flow diagrams are used to graphically represent the flow of data in any information system. DFD describes the processes that are involved in a system to transfer data from the input to the file storage and reports generation.

### Preparing a Rest API based Backend

Once we have a clear documentation and clarity over the modules to be built. We build a centralised server interface to manage the buckets and manage I/O streams. Also authentication and Public Private Key based encryption will be designed.

### Client Side Application Development

This is where major development, overlooked by us and in active involvement with the community takes place.
- Full stack deployed portal for API
- Android Frontend
- Cross Platform Desktop App in the following order
- Windows
- Mac
- Linux
- Android

### SDK and Guidelines for further platforms

This is where the community comes in, we will all do our part in extending and maintaining the resources to develop these functionalities to all available platforms - Micro controllers, smart televisions, iOS, and perhaps Xbox too, and then a few more.

### Contributors : 

We plan to publicise Once our backend service is ready, the endpoints can be utilised by several domain experts in their respective fields. We hope some Open Source organization mentors us in our attempt to make this clipboard viable, and we will definitely need to market this on our own.
